Pi/DHT22 script using the adafruit_dht CircuitPython module

also requires libgpiod, eg:
	sudo apt install libgpiod2

Note that pigpiod can use a significant amount of CPU. This can be reduced by
	- Using the -m option to disable alert sampling
	(hm, trying this and it may not work)
	- Using '-s 10' to lower the sample rate to 10us (from 5us default)
