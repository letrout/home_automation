Pi/DHT22 script using pigpio to query the sensor
See http://abyz.me.uk/rpi/pigpio/

The adafruit_dht CircuitPython module has not worked for me on RPi 1B
(although it works on my RPi 4B), but pigpio does work.

also requires libgpiod, eg:
	sudo apt install libgpiod2

Note that pigpiod can use a significant amount of CPU. This can be reduced by
	- Using the -m option to disable alert sampling
	(hm, trying this and it may not work)
	- Using '-s 10' to lower the sample rate to 10us (from 5us default)
